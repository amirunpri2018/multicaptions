ABOUT THIS DEMO
This project demonstrates how to use the Noritake_VFD_GU3000
code library to change the brightness of the screen on the
Noritake GU-3000 Vacuum Fluorescent Display (VFD) modules.
You MUST download and install the Noritake_VFD_GU3000 code
library before running the demo.

    http://www.noritake-elec.com

Please refer to the instructions on the download page and
"README" included with the Noritake_VFD_GU3000 code library for
information on how to install the Noritake_VFD_GU3000 code
library and demos.  This document assumes that you have already
configured the "config.h" file in the Noritake_VFD_GU3000 code
library as described in those documents.

For more information on the methods used in this document,
please refer to the method documentation in the
Noritake_VFD_GU3000 code library.

----------------------------------------------------------------
KEY POINTS
1) initialize the module with GU3000_init().
2) Use GU3000_setScreenBrightness() to set the screen brightness
   as a percentage from 0% - 100%: 0% turns the screen off;
   100% turns the screen to its maximum brightness.
3) Though the value is given as a percentage, the display only
   has 8 levels of brightness:
    13%, 25%, 38%, 50%, 63%, 75%, 88%, and 100%
   Any percent other than these is rounded up to the next
   possible level.

LISTING
#include "../src/config.h"
#include "../src/Noritake_VFD_GU3000.h"
Noritake_VFD_GU3000 vfd;

int main() {
    vfd.GU3000_init();
    vfd.print("Noritake");
    for (;;)
        // go from 0% - 100% in 9 steps
        for (int i = 0; i <= 8; i++) {
            int percent = i * 125 / 10;
            vfd.GU3000_setScreenBrightness(percent);
            vfd.GU3000_setCursor(0, 8);
            vfd.print(percent, 10);
            vfd.print("% Brightness");
            _delay_ms(1000);
        }
