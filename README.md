# External Subtitles for Video Installations (extsub)

External Subtitles for Video Installations (extsub) plays fullscreen video (up to full HD) while simultaneously processing and displaying subtitles in one or more selectable languages on a separate graphic LCD display. It is an affordable (~$150 USD per unit), easy-to-build, easy-to-maintain, open source project using completely off-the-shelf hardware. extsub is inspired by [Figaro System's Simultext](http://www.figaro-systems.com/simultextreg.html) (known as ["Met Titles"](http://www.nytimes.com/1995/10/02/arts/reinventing-supertitles-how-the-met-did-it.html?pagewanted=all) at the NYC Metropolitan Opera).
